Astronmical Dendrograms
=======================

The aim of this module is to provide an easy way to compute dendrograms of
observed or simulated Astronomical data in Python. The easiest way to think of
a dendrogram is to think of a tree that represents the hiearchy of the
structures in your data. For an example of use of dendrograms on real data,
see `Goodman, A. et al (2009) <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009Natur.457...63G>`_.

A dendrogram is composed of two types of structures: *branches*, which are
structures which split into multiple sub-structures, and branches, which are
structures that have no sub-structure. Branches can split up into branches and
leaves, resulting in a hiearchical structure.
